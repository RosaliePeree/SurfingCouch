	        \paragraph{}The following table presents our choice of model and methods for the problems that we listed in our project description (see Appendix \#1):
	        \paragraph{}

	        \begin{tabular}{|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|p{5.1cm}|}
	            \hline

                \hline
                \hline
                How can we develop a social application which is fun to use and rewards the user for helping travellers in their area? 
                & How to make the application interesting for our potential users?
                & We have to pay attention to all the following problems to be able to develop an application that will address all of them as good as possible.\\
                \hline
                What is important for travellers?
                & As our application is mainly targeted to travellers, it is interesting to know what is important for them, so that we cant try to implement those things in the final application.
                & We conducted a survey via Google Forms to gather people's opinion on that subject.\\
                \hline
                What is important for hosts?
                & As we want hosts to offer services to travellers, we have to meet with what they want to encourage them to do so.
                & We conducted a survey via Google Forms to gather potential user's opinion on that subject.\\
                \hline
                How can we allow users to create and find trips in their area and offer a service to travellers?
                & This problem is the main problem for a couch-surfing-like application. We have to localize the user to be able to provide a service for them in a specific area.
                & We have to set up a way for the users to enter their city/location and look for hosts in cities they want to visit.\\
                \hline
                How can we make the service secure for users?
                & Users don't want their personal data to be forwarded to strangers.
                & No personal data is displayed on the application for users to see. We implemented an internal messaging system so people can communicate directly on the application.\\
                \hline
                Can we add reviews and comments about travellers and hosts?
                & If you have to host someone or sleep/shower at a stranger's place, safety is very important. Users need a way to see if someone behaved correctly or not before their stay.
                & We implemented a system of user reviews - with grades - so people can report how they experience was with that specific user - hosts and travellers.\\
                \hline
            \end{tabular}

                \hline
                \hline
                How can we define the point-value of the provided services?
                & As the system is based on a reward, all services must have a fixed value.
                & We defined a value for each service - sleep, shower and laundry. The points are given to the host once the booking is completed.\\
                \hline
                How can we exchange the points for gifts?
                & The system is based on rewarding hosts with gifts for providing a service.
                & We set up an online shop where users can exchange their points for goods.\\
                \hline
                How will the user interface be implemented?
                & The user interface has to be easy to get and use.
                & The interface will be an Android application.\\
                \hline
                What kind of tool will be used for this implementation?
                & The tools used to develop can make the process of developing the application more or less easy.
                & We decided to develop the application using Android Studio, as it is the platform we are both most familiar with.\\
                \hline
                How will the interface be user-friendly?
                & The interface has to be easy to use and understand for any user.
                & The interface is simple, with buttons and labels that are easy to understand. \\
                \hline
                How is the social interaction going to take place?
                &The point of the assignment is to enable a social interaction.
                & In our application, the social interaction will take place in the form of direct messaging between two users, a common chat for all the users and the possibility of reviewing experience with other users.\\
                \hline
                What kind of database will be implemented?
                & We need a database that is free and easy to integrate in Android.
                & The chosen database is Firebase for our project.\\
                \hline

        \section{Requirements}
        % COMPLETE SECTION DONE
        % PROOF READ TO DO
        	\paragraph{}The users of the application will be any person interested in traveling on a budget or having a different traveling experience, as well of any person that will be willing to host or provide a service -for now, shower and laundry - to a traveller visiting their city. They could be from everywhere in the world and have about any age, as long as they have access to a mobile phone running Android and a working Internet connection. They should not have an extensive knowledge of computer science to be able to use the application.
        	\subsection{List of Requirements}
        		\paragraph{}Before starting any implementation, we conducted a survey to gather some data about potential users. Here are some of the results that could be interesting:
        		\begin{itemize}
        			\item \textbf{More than 70\%} of the people that replied are using an Android phone. Developing a native Android application seems to be a good strategic choice.
        			\item Again, \textbf{more than 70\%} of the people would be interested to collect rewards by hosting someone. For \textbf{3\/4 th} of those people, it would also depend of the rewards.
        			\item For \textbf{more than 50\% }of the travellers, safety is the most important.
        			\item For \textbf{20\% }of our potential hosts, getting a reward would encourage them to host people in their home.
        			\item For more statistics, refers to graphics in Annex B.
        		\end{itemize}

		                \paragraph{}The second activity diagram groups some activities together. The activities that are merged together on the diagram are distinct activities, but have the same behavior and thus can be grouped together. This is done to avoid this diagram to become too complicated to read.

        			\begin{itemize}
        				\item Password requirements (set up by Firebase)
        				\item Password security (hashed)
        				\item Password not saved unencrypted
        				\item If password lost, email to make a new one (handled by Firebase)
        			\end{itemize}
        			\paragraph{Usability}
        			\begin{itemize}
        				\item User friendly

        % COMPLETE SECTION TO DO
        % PROOF READ TO DO
        	\subsection{Architecture}
				\paragraph{}We used the Adapter in Android which is close to a Pattern Adapter.

				\begin{figure}[!htbp]
					\center
		            \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img/adapterpattern.png}
		            \caption{Adapter Pattern Template (\textit{softwarepassion.com})}
				\end{figure}

				\paragraph{}We used those Adapters to populate the listViews with ArrayList and make clickable. Those Adapters are customizable, and help to display the content of the Objects that are kept in the database 

				\paragraph{}We also wanted to use a MVC (Model View Controller), which is a MVP (Model View Presenter) but the scope of the project was too short to implement it correctly, and we didn't studied it during the Android course.

        	\newpage
        	\subsection{Technologies}
        		
				\paragraph{}\textbf{Surfing Couch} uses different technologies :\\
				\paragraph{}To do deal with all of the data manipulated by the users, the applications uses \textbf{Firebase} as database : \\
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Pros :
						\begin{itemize}
						\item 	Firebase provides an easy implementation on an Android application, there is not that much of a setup to do, the read and write functions are really easy to implement
						\item 	Firebase use JSON which permits an implementation of data in a fairly effortless way. That create a database that is flexible, well-structured and easy to read to some extent.
						\item 	Firebase gives useful tools, including a user authentication that deals with the security of database thanks to its data hashing. Firebase is also loaded with email confirmation, data analytics, and stability tools, which helps to make the user experience better.
						\item 	Made by Google
						\end{itemize}

					\item Cons :
						\begin{itemize}
						\item	When the data structure starts to be a bit complex, it becomes quite hard to navigate through all of the data. Especially if you have a lot of data.
						\item	The querying and indexing is very limited due to the use of the JSON. It makes the search of data is very redundant.
						\item	Firebase is a bit high level, so you don’t feel you have that much of control over it
						\item	Made by Google
						\end{itemize}
				\end{itemize}

				\paragraph{}One of the alternative to Firebase could be to use a more “classical” database management system like \textbf{SQLite} :
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Pros :
						\begin{itemize}
							\item	Classical way to store data, you can do SQL queries on it to retrieve data with more efficiency. Include also a good indexing of the data.
							\item	Is better than Firebase at storing huge load of data.
						\end{itemize}
					\item Cons :
						\begin{itemize}
							\item	You don’t have the tools proposed by Firebase, so you can really analyze your data usage and you must make all of the part of the security by yourself
							\item	Harder to use and implement than Firebase.
						\end{itemize}
				\end{itemize}

				\paragraph{}The application must be developed natively on Android, so \textbf{Android Studio} was a default choice to develop the application. But it's interesting to point out that there is alternatives to Android Studio such as \textbf{Xamarin} or \textbf{Cordova}.

			\subsection{Design Patterns, Class Diagram, Sequence Diagrams}

				\paragraph{}Like said earlier, we are not using a specific design pattern.

					\begin{figure}[!htbp]
						\center
	                    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{img/class_diagram.png}
	                    \caption{Class Diagram of the database } 
					\end{figure}

				\paragraph{}The database\footnote{We made a class diagram for the database because the data is kept in a JSON} is pretty straightforward, everything is based around the User. However, we must highlight some details. By default, when a user is created, the bookings are null, so not present in the database JSON. The list is created with the first booking he makes.
				\paragraph{}Also, a default chat is assigned to each user which is the “General Chat” so can talk all together. The other List are defined as “undefined” and taken as HashMaps inside of the application.
				
						\begin{sidewaysfigure}[!htbp]
							\center
		                    \includegraphics[scale=0.55]{img/activity.png}
		                    \caption{Class Diagram of the application Activities } 
						\end{sidewaysfigure}
				\paragraph{}All of the activities apart from the MainActivity and the Adapter are extending the NavigationDrawerActivity which is itself extending AppCompatActivity.
				\paragraph{}A user can add review only once per User, and some Display activities are accessible according if you are on your profile or someone else profile
				\paragraph{}Each Activities have an OnCreate() function and other (OnStart(), OnStop()), since those methods are part of the life cycle there aren’t displayed.
				\paragraph{}Each Adapter have overridable methods, that are also not displayed on the diagram

            user = dataSnapshot.getValue(User.class);
            if (user.getConversations() == null) {
                Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), R.string.message_empty, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();

            } else {
                        allChats.clear();
                for (String value : user.getConversations().values()) {

            Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), R.string.message_error, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
        }
    });
	\end{lstlisting}
	\paragraph{}We can access to the message in two different ways. The first way is to pass through the MessageActivity, which display the list of the conversation that the connected user possesses. By default, the user has the ``''General Chat``''. He just has to click on the name of the chat to open it thanks to the \textbf{MessageAdapter}.
\paragraph{} When the User accesses the \textbf{MessageActivity}, we create a reference on the database and the put a \textit{addListenerForSingleValueEvent} to fetch the data from the Database. We use the \textit{snapshot} to retrieve the \textbf{User} data and then we store the data inside of an array that we put inside of an adapter that is used to display the data in the ListView
\begin{lstlisting}
    listOfChats.setOnItemClickListener(new AdapterView.OnItemClickListener() {
        @Override
        public void onItemClick(AdapterView<?> adapterView, View view, int i, long l) {
            Intent intent = new Intent();
            intent.setClass(getApplicationContext(),ChatActivity.class);
            intent.putExtra("position", i);

            intent.putExtra("chatName", listOfChats.getItemAtPosition(i).toString());
            startActivity(intent);
        }
    });

        	\end{lstlisting}

        	\paragraph{}When the user clicks on a chat name, we get the position of the click and the name of the chat selected, that we send into an intent to open the chat. The intent will be used to open the correct chat.
			\paragraph{}If no chat exists between some users, a user can go the profile of someone and click on send message to create a conversation and use CheckConversationActivity.

\begin{lstlisting}
if(currentUser.getConversations() != null || displayedUser.getConversations() != null) {
    loop:
    {
        for (String conv : currentUser.getConversations().values()) {

                if (Objects.equals(conv, conv2) && !Objects.equals(conv, "General Chat")) {

                    intent.putExtra("chatName", conv2);

        	\paragraph{} This is an example of how the writing a message is made. 
			\paragraph{}At first, we are checking if the input field of the user is empty or not. We have to trim it in case of the User just put a blank space. 
			\paragraph{}If the input field is not empty, we can fetch the date and the time at the moment the send button was pressed, and we write all of the relevant data into the database and then we empty the input field.
			\paragraph{}To write in the database, we have to get a reference on the database and then look for where we want to write the data which here is: 'Conversation\/>chat\_name>\/listOfMessages'
			\paragraph{}The push value will add a new instance of the object \textbf{Message} that contains a UserID, a username, the user text and a timestamp.

			\begin{lstlisting}
public class Message {
    protected String senderID;
    private String senderName;
    private String text;
